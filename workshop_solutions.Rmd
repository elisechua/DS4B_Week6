# Bonus section

## Loading the data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
crab <- read_csv("raw_data/data.csv")
crab
```

## An interesting plot

### Allometry
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = crab, aes(x=(VO2_ml_per_h/weight), y=TempC, colour=Sex)) +
  geom_point() +

```
```{r}
ggplot(data = crab, aes(x=weight, y=VO2_ml_per_h, colour=Sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  labs(
    title="Relationship between metabolic rate and weight, by sex",
    x="weight(g)",
    y="ml oxygen consumed / hour")
```
At weights higher than around 0.1g, females have higher energy expenditure than males. Due to heavier investment in reproduction? Or hormones?
